# Stock-Recommendation-System

This repository contains code for a basic stock recommender system based on interaction between a customer and the company whose shares they are purchasing. It utilizes a technqiue called Singular Value Decompostion or SVD(a matrix factorization tecnhique) that stores the factors related to customer-company interaction(in this it is the amount purchased).

The data is generated is simple, and created based on a kaggle dataset which contains stock details for s&p500 companies. More complex datasets will include lot more features but the principle of the recommender system will remain same.


The data generation notebook contains details on the creation of the dataset.
